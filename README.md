# Hello, I'm Yizhou Lu! ðŸ‘‹ðŸŒŸ

## ðŸ“š About Me

I'm a recent graduate ðŸŽ“ passionate about data analysis and statistics, currently seeking opportunities to start my career as a SAS Programmer or Biostatistician. With a solid foundation in statistical theories and a knack for programming, I aim to leverage data ðŸ“Š to uncover insights and drive evidence-based decisions. My academic background and project experiences have equipped me with a strong skill set in statistical analysis, data manipulation, and visualization, making me ready to tackle real-world data challenges.

- Relevant Courses: Statistical Methods, Data Analysis, Biostatistics, Computer Programming, Bayesian Statistics, etc.
- **Bachelor's Degree** in **Biology** from **Southern Utah University**, **Spring 2021**
- Relevant Courses: Genetics, Molecular Biology, bio/chem lab, etc.

## ðŸ’¼ Skills

- **Programming Languages:** SAS, R, Python
- **Statistical Software:** SAS (Base, Stat, Macro, SQL), RStudio
- **Data Analysis:** Descriptive Statistics, Linear Regression, Survival Analysis, Longitudinal Analysis, R Shiny
- **Visualization Tools:** SAS Visual Analytics, Pandas, GGplot2 in R
- **Other Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation, Report Writing, Machine Learning

## ðŸš€ Projects

### 2023 Hackathon for Healthï¼ˆHeld by CTSI,NMDSI,MCW)
- The survival analysis to identify Obstructive Sleep Apnea affecting the Likelihood of Cancer Mortality on CTSI EHR Datasets.
- The team I was on analysis the Likelihood of Cancer Mortality with effect of Sleep Apnea, which was 
  unanimous approved by the jury and professors, and won the 1st place.
- Conducted survival analysis to identify OSA affecting the Likelihood of Cancer Mortality on CTSI datasets, employing the Kaplan-Meier method using proc lifetest and the Cox proportional hazard model using proc phreg to examine time-to- 
  event data. (e.g. death, hospitalization).


### Southeast Wisconsin Data Science Collaborative Research Symposium (R Shiny App)
- Using Python and RStudio, I designed a Shiny app that allows individuals without a coding background to perform data cleaning and visualization. Additionally, the app incorporates the OpenAI API, enabling users to interact with the 
  data through natural language processing. This integration not only simplifies complex data analysis tasks but also enhances accessibility, making it easier for users to gain insights from their data without the need for programming 
  expertise.
